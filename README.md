# PRODIGY_CS_Task-2
### Second Internship Task at Prodigitech! üöÄ

I am excited to share my second project as a Cyber Security Intern at Prodigitech. This time, 
I developed a user-friendly image encryption tool using Python, NumPy, and PIL.
The task was to create a tool that can encrypt and decrypt images by performing basic pixel
manipulation operations. Here's a brief overview of the application:

üîê **Features:**

- **Encrypt/Decrypt Mode:** Users can switch between encryption and decryption modes using a specified key.
- **Pixel Manipulation:** The tool modifies pixel values to make the image unreadable during encryption and restores the original image during decryption.
- **Key Input:** A dedicated field to input the encryption key (an integer) for the encryption and decryption process.
- **Image Input/Output:** Allows users to select the input image and specify paths to save the encrypted and decrypted images.
- **Efficient Processing:** Utilizes NumPy for efficient pixel value manipulation and PIL for handling image file operations.

For more details and to access the source code, check out my GitHub repository here.

I am looking forward to continuing my journey in cybersecurity at Prodigitech, working on more challenging and innovative projects. Stay tuned for more updates!
